        <p className="mb-1.5">
          I always was fascinated by the idea of virtual reality even from a
          very young age. I never thought that the technology would be viable as
          soon as the early 2010s though.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-1.5">
          Mid-2015, I was lucky enough to try a friend's Oculus DK2 and even
          though the tech was still experimental, it seemed to me there that was
          a good enough base for a new wave of VR software. I did not think much
          of it at first since I was an just a junior web dev already trying his
          best to get good at his craft.

          In 2016 another friend of mine taught me about{" "}
          <a className="underline" href="https://aframe.io/">
            A-Frame
          </a>
          . Thanks to him I saw a path where I could reconcile my craft with my
          interest

          I understood that 3D and VR were going to a be growing part of the
          web. I felt like even if a few percent of the web became
          tridimensional, I needed to explore in what ways 3D and VR could
          change or integrate with the way we use the web.

        <p>
          In 2016 the "Metaverse" was very much not a thing but this was
          basically the way too ambitious idea of this project. The idea was an
          app where multiple users could spend time and create an environment
          together where they could share medias like watching YouTube videos.
