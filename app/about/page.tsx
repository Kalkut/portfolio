          I always was fascinated by the idea of virtual reality even from a
          very young age. I never thought that the technology would be viable as
          soon as the early 2010s though.

          Mid-2015, I was lucky enough to try a friend's Oculus DK2 and even
          though the tech was still experimental, it seemed to me there that was
          a good enough base for a new wave of VR software. I did not think much
          of it at first since I was an just a junior web dev already trying his
          best to get good at his craft.

          </a>
          . Thanks to him I saw a path where I could reconcile my craft with my
          interest

          I developed the strong belief that 3D and immersive technologies were
          going to a be growing part of the web. I felt like even if a few
          percent of the web became tridimensional, I needed to explore in what
          ways 3D and VR could change or integrate with the way we use the web.

          Since 2016 I split my time between full stack developement work for
          customers and experimentation with the web immersive
